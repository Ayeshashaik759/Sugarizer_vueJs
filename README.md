This activity was developed by [Saumya Kushwaha](https://github.com/S-kus) under the guidance of [Lionel Lask√©](https://github.com/llaske) during GSoC 2022.

The project aims to create a framework of Vue.js UI components matching the Sugar UI by replacing old EnyoJS, a deprecated framework initially developed for WebOS. The VueJS source code is maintained here and, once built, the code is integrated in [Sugarizer](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer).
